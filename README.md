This addon is a treasure casket helper for Final Fantasy XI, designed for use with Ashita v4 (Beta Final).

With the addon loaded, simply click on any brown treasure casket and it will display information about possible combinations, suggest the best number to guess, and show the worst-case chance of guessing correctly.

The suggestions automatically update as new hints are revealed.

### Usage
For simplicity rename the folder to 'boxdestroyer' and place into your Ashita > Addons folder.

Use `/addon load boxdestroyer` to enable.

Alternatively, add `/addon load boxdestroyer` to `Default.txt` under Ashita's `scripts` directory.

Unload using `/addon unload boxdestroyer`.
